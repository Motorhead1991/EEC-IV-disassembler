# EEC-IV-disassembler
semi automatic disassembler for Ford EEC-IV and V binaries

this is the first post, I am learning as I go....

I have posted the basic source files here which should compile with pretty much any of the standard C or c++ compilers out there
I admit some of the code is a bit messy and I use lots of pointers ...

These source files are directly from my DEVELOPMENT stage, so have extra commented out code etc.   I will tidy them up as I go....
