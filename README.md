# EEC-IV-disassembler
semi automatic disassembler for Ford EEC-IV and V binaries - latest is 3.02

MORE to come.

Slightly out of date documentation is posted here - 98% is exactly the same, so still a good guide.

NOTE - this code is intended to help understand only how each EEC works, not as a tuning tool.
